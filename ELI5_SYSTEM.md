# 🤖 ELI5 System Documentation

This document explains the ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) system for generating intelligent explanations of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Pre-Generation Approach
Instead of generating ELI5 explanations on-demand (which was slow and expensive), the system now uses a **pre-generation approach**:

1. **Initial Generation**: Server generates ELI5 for first 5 BIPs on startup
2. **Batch Generation**: Run script to generate remaining ELI5 explanations
3. **Storage**: All explanations are stored persistently in the file cache
4. **Fast Delivery**: BIP pages load instantly with pre-generated content

### Benefits
- ✅ **Fast Loading**: No waiting for API calls when viewing BIPs
- ✅ **Cost Efficient**: Generate once, serve many times
- ✅ **Reliable**: No dependency on real-time API availability
- ✅ **Scalable**: Can pre-generate thousands of explanations

## 📁 File Structure

```
scripts/
├── generate-eli5.js          # Main ELI5 generation script
server/
├── openai.ts                 # OpenAI integration
├── routes.ts                 # Background generation on startup
└── storage.ts                # Persistent storage
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Generate All ELI5 Explanations
```bash
# Generate ELI5 for all BIPs that don't have one
npm run generate-eli5

# Force regenerate ALL ELI5 explanations
npm run generate-eli5 --force
```

### Setup Requirements
1. **OpenAI API Key**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
2. **BIP Data**: Ensure BIPs are fetched from GitHub first
3. **Storage**: File-based storage must be initialized

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required for ELI5 generation
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Optional: Custom rate limiting
export ELI5_BATCH_SIZE=3
export ELI5_DELAY_MS=1000
```

## 🤖 OpenAI Integration

### Model Configuration
- **Model**: GPT-4o (latest OpenAI model)
- **Max Tokens**: 300
- **Temperature**: 0.7
- **Target Length**: 150-180 words

### Prompt Engineering
The system uses carefully crafted prompts to generate:
1. **Problem Statement**: What issue the BIP solves
2. **Technical Solution**: How it works (with Bitcoin-specific definitions)
3. **Impact Assessment**: Why it matters for Bitcoin users

### Example Output
> "BIP 141 (Segregated Witness) addresses Bitcoin's transaction malleability problem and block size limitations. The solution moves transaction signatures (witnesses) to a separate data structure outside the main transaction block. This prevents attackers from modifying transaction IDs while keeping the same spending permissions. Segregated Witness effectively increases block capacity from 1MB to approximately 4MB without requiring a hard fork, as older nodes see witness-stripped transactions as valid. The implementation enables second-layer scaling solutions like Lightning Network by eliminating malleability attacks that could disrupt payment channels. For Bitcoin users, this means faster confirmation times, lower transaction fees, and support for more advanced payment features while maintaining backward compatibility with existing wallets and infrastructure."

## 🔄 Generation Process

### Startup Sequence
1. Server starts up and warms cache
2. If cache is empty/stale, fetch BIPs from GitHub  
3. Automatically generate ELI5 for first 5 BIPs
4. Log message suggests running full generation script

### Batch Processing
1. Load all BIPs from storage
2. Filter BIPs that need ELI5 generation
3. Process in batches of 3 (configurable)
4. 1-second delay between API calls
5. 3-second delay between batches
6. Save each generated ELI5 immediately

### Error Handling
- **API Failures**: Provide intelligent fallback explanations
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Missing Config**: Warn and use fallback content
- **Network Issues**: Continue with remaining BIPs

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### No ELI5 Content Showing
1. Check if OpenAI API key is configured
2. Verify BIPs have been fetched from GitHub
3. Run generation script manually: `npm run generate-eli5`
4. Check server logs for error messages

### API Rate Limiting
```bash
# Reduce batch size and increase delays
export ELI5_BATCH_SIZE=1
export ELI5_DELAY_MS=3000
```

### Regenerate Specific BIPs
Currently, the system generates ELI5 for all missing ones. To regenerate specific BIPs:
1. Clear the ELI5 field from storage
2. Run the generation script
3. Or restart the server (will generate first 5)

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Generation Prompt
Edit the prompt in `server/openai.ts` to change the style, length, or focus of explanations.

### Change Batch Processing
Modify `scripts/generate-eli5.js`:
- `batchSize`: Number of BIPs processed simultaneously
- Delays between API calls and batches
- Error handling behavior

### Storage Backend
The system uses file-based storage by default. To use a different storage backend, implement the `IStorage` interface in `server/storage.ts`.

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Generation Speed
- **Average**: 2-3 seconds per ELI5 (including API call)
- **Batch of 3**: ~8 seconds total
- **Full Generation**: ~2-3 hours for 400+ BIPs

### Storage Requirements
- **Each ELI5**: ~200-300 characters
- **Total Storage**: ~100KB for all explanations
- **Cache Files**: Stored in `.cache/bips.json`

### Cost Estimation (OpenAI)
- **Per ELI5**: ~$0.002-0.003 USD
- **Full Generation**: ~$1-2 USD for all BIPs
- **One-time Cost**: No recurring charges
